# 1. Hello World
# ==========================================
# CONCEPT: The First Program
# ==========================================
# Why? This is the traditional first step in learning any language.
# It tests if Python is installed and working correctly.
#
# How? The `print()` function takes text (a string) and displays it on the screen.

print("Hello, World!")

# Common Errors:
# 1. print "Hello" (Missing parentheses - Python 2 style error)
# 2. Print("Hello") (Capital P - Python is case sensitive)
